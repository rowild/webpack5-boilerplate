# webpack5-boilerplate
With tailwindcss2, pug, ejs, postcss

This is the basis to quickly create HTML click dummies with Vanilla JS.
A key feature is to use partials. Webpack supports a plugin called 
HtmlWebpackPlugin, which allows to render various template engines.

This boilerplate provides a solution for using lodash (the standard,
"no need for configuration" [as per documentation] way), ejs and pug.
handlebars will soon follow.
